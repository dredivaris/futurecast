## 1. Results Chatbot
*   **Usefulness Rank:** 1
*   **Difficulty:** **[H]**
*   **Summary:** Introduces an interactive AI assistant (chatbot) that allows users to conversationally query, modify, and expand a generated futurecast (initial seed prompt, effect tree, and results summary).
*   **Expanded Description:** This feature aims to make the exploration and refinement of futurecasts more dynamic and intuitive. After an initial prediction tree and summary are generated, users can engage with a chatbot that has full contextual awareness of the scenario. Key capabilities would include:
    *   **Conversational Q&A:** Users can ask open-ended, natural language questions about the generated futurecast, such as "What are the primary economic impacts predicted in this scenario?", "Can you explain the link between effect A and its child effect B?", or "What underlying assumptions seem to be driving the predictions in the 'Technology Adoption' branch?". The chatbot would synthesize information from the initial prompt, the effect tree, and the summary to provide answers.
    *   **Interactive Tree Modification via Chat:** Users could instruct the chatbot to alter the futurecast. For example:
        *   "Change the effect 'Increased remote work adoption' to 'Hybrid work models become dominant'." The chatbot would update the specified effect's content and then re-trigger the prediction engine to regenerate all downstream effects from this modified node, maintaining consistency.
        *   "Remove the entire branch starting with the effect 'Significant decline in commercial real estate'."
    *   **Targeted Expansion via Chat:** Users could direct the chatbot to deepen specific parts of the prediction tree: "Expand the leaf effect 'Development of new AI-powered diagnostic tools' by 2 more levels, focusing on implications for rural healthcare." The chatbot would then generate new child effects for the specified node and integrate them seamlessly into the existing tree structure.
    *   This feature centralizes interaction, allowing for a fluid, iterative process of exploring, refining, and extending the futurecast without needing to manually restart or navigate complex editing UIs for every change. It requires sophisticated RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation), state management, and careful LLM prompting for modification and expansion tasks.

## 2. Solution/Mitigation Suggestion
*   **Usefulness Rank:** 2
*   **Difficulty:** **[M]**
*   **Summary:** Allows users to select one or more negative/concerning effects from the prediction tree and prompt the LLM to suggest potential solutions, mitigation strategies, or contingency plans for those specific effects.
*   **Expanded Description:** This feature extends FutureCast's capabilities from purely predictive to also prescriptive, offering actionable insights. When a user identifies a problematic effect, they can trigger this feature. The LLM would then be prompted with the context of the initial scenario, the selected negative effect (and potentially its surrounding effects), to brainstorm and generate:
    *   **Preventative Measures:** Actions or policies that could be implemented to prevent the negative effect from occurring.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:** Steps to lessen the impact or severity of the negative effect if it does materialize.
    *   **Contingency Plans:** Alternative courses of action or backup plans to be enacted if the negative effect occurs.
    *   **Opportunity Identification (for positive effects):** Could also be adapted to suggest ways to capitalize on or amplify positive predicted effects.
    *   The UI would need to allow easy selection of effects and clear presentation of these AI-generated suggestions, perhaps linking them directly to the relevant nodes in the tree. This adds significant value for risk management, strategic planning, and policy development.

## 3. Probability/Likelihood Scores
*   **Usefulness Rank:** 3
*   **Difficulty:** **[M]**
*   **Summary:** Modifies prompts to ask the LLM to assign a subjective probability or likelihood score (e.g., Low/Medium/High, or a 1-5 scale) to each generated effect. These scores would be visually displayed on the tree/mind map.
*   **Expanded Description:** To help users differentiate between highly probable outcomes and more speculative ones, this feature would integrate a likelihood assessment into the prediction process. For each effect generated, the LLM would also be asked to provide an estimated likelihood.
    *   This could be a categorical label (e.g., "Very Likely," "Likely," "Possible," "Unlikely," "Highly Unlikely") or a numerical score.
    *   Prompt engineering would be crucial to guide the LLM in making these assessments based on the chain of preceding effects and the overall scenario context.
    *   The UI would then visually represent these scores on the prediction tree or mind map, using color-coding, icons, text labels, or varying node opacity. This allows users to quickly identify critical paths of high-probability events or to de-prioritize branches that are deemed less likely, aiding in focusing analysis and decision-making. A challenge lies in the subjective nature of LLM-generated probabilities and potential needs for calibration or clear communication of their qualitative nature.

## 4. Time Horizon Specification
*   **Usefulness Rank:** 4
*   **Difficulty:** **[M]**
*   **Summary:** Allows users to specify a rough time horizon for their predictions (e.g., "next 6 months," "1-3 years," "5+ years"). The LLM would then be prompted to tailor the scope and nature of predicted effects accordingly.
*   **Expanded Description:** The relevance and type of cascading effects often vary significantly with the timeframe under consideration. This feature would enable users to define a specific time horizon for their analysis (e.g., immediate, short-term, medium-term, long-term, or specific year ranges).
    *   The application would then incorporate this user-defined time horizon into the prompts sent to the LLM. The LLM would be instructed to generate effects that are most plausible and impactful within that specified period. For instance, short-term effects might be more operational or direct, while long-term effects could encompass broader societal shifts or strategic outcomes.
    *   This helps in generating more focused, relevant, and actionable predictions, preventing the LLM from producing effects that are too immediate for a long-range forecast or too far-reaching and abstract for a short-term analysis. It requires careful prompt engineering to ensure the LLM consistently adheres to the specified temporal scope.

## 5. Interactive Node Editing & "Re-Roll" (Direct Manipulation)
*   **Usefulness Rank:** 5
*   **Difficulty:** **[H]**
*   **Summary:** Provides users with direct, granular control to manually edit the text of an existing effect, add new effects, or delete effects/branches directly within the visual tree or mind map. Includes an option to "re-roll" (re-generate) downstream effects from any edited or selected node.
*   **Expanded Description:** As an alternative or complement to chatbot-based interaction, this feature offers a direct manipulation interface for refining the prediction tree. Users could:
    *   **Edit Content:** Click on an effect node in the visual display and directly modify its textual description.
    *   **Add Node:** Manually insert a new effect node as a child of an existing effect or as a new root-level effect, defining its content.
    *   **Delete Node/Branch:** Remove an individual effect node or an entire branch (the selected node and all its descendants).
    *   **"Re-Roll" Sub-tree:** After editing an effect, or to explore alternative pathways from a specific point, the user could select a node and trigger a re-generation of all its child effects (the sub-tree). The system would use the (potentially new) content of the selected node as the parent context for this re-generation, using current or newly specified parameters.
    *   This allows for precise fine-tuning, correction of LLM outputs, or manual guidance of the prediction process. It demands sophisticated UI state management, robust interaction with the underlying tree data structure, and careful integration with the prediction engine to trigger and incorporate partial re-generations.

## 6. Enhanced Export Options
*   **Usefulness Rank:** 6
*   **Difficulty:** **[M]**
*   **Summary:** Expands the ability to export the prediction tree and summary to various formats beyond the current JSON, such as PDF, DOCX (Word), enhanced Markdown, or CSV.
*   **Expanded Description:** To improve the utility of FutureCast outputs for reporting, sharing, and further analysis in other tools, this feature would offer a richer set of export formats:
    *   **PDF:** A well-formatted, printable report including the initial context, the full summary, and a visual or structured representation of the prediction tree. This might involve options for condensing large trees.
    *   **DOCX (Word Document):** Similar to PDF but in an editable format, allowing users to easily incorporate the futurecast into their own reports, add annotations, or reformat as needed.
    *   **Enhanced Markdown:** A text-based export that preserves the hierarchical structure of the prediction tree using Markdown headings or nested lists. This is useful for version control systems (like Git), embedding in wikis, or processing with other Markdown tools.
    *   **CSV (Comma Separated Values):** A flat-file format where each row represents an individual effect, including its ID, content, order (depth), parent ID, and any other associated metadata (like likelihood or sentiment scores if those features are implemented). Useful for data analysis in spreadsheets or databases.
    *   Implementation would involve selecting and integrating appropriate libraries for each target format and designing clear, useful layouts for the exported content.

## 7. User Accounts & Cloud-Saved Scenarios
*   **Usefulness Rank:** 7
*   **Difficulty:** **[H]**
*   **Summary:** Implements user authentication and allows users to save, manage, name, and categorize their futurecast scenarios in the cloud, making them accessible across different sessions and devices.
*   **Expanded Description:** This feature transitions FutureCast from a purely local tool to a web-enabled platform, enabling persistence and broader accessibility. It would involve:
    *   **User Authentication:** A secure system for user registration, login, and password management.
    *   **Cloud Storage:** Storing all aspects of a futurecast scenario (initial context, full prediction tree, summary, user configurations, timestamps, etc.) in a cloud-based database.
    *   **Scenario Management Dashboard:** A user interface where users can view a list of their saved scenarios, give them meaningful names, add descriptive tags or notes, organize them (e.g., into folders or projects), and easily load, duplicate, or delete them.
    *   **Cross-Device Access:** Users could start a scenario on one device and continue working on it or view it on another.
    *   This is a foundational feature for enabling more advanced capabilities such as collaboration, version history, and personalized settings. It requires significant backend development (database schema, APIs, authentication logic) and corresponding frontend UI changes.

## 8. Sentiment Analysis & Visualization
*   **Usefulness Rank:** 8
*   **Difficulty:** **[M]**
*   **Summary:** Automatically runs sentiment analysis (e.g., positive, negative, neutral) on the content of each generated effect. This sentiment would then be visually represented on the tree/mind map, for instance, by color-coding the nodes.
*   **Expanded Description:** To provide users with an at-a-glance understanding of the overall tone and nature of predicted outcomes within different branches of the tree, this feature would:
    *   Process the textual content of each generated effect.
    *   Employ an LLM (either the main one via a specific prompt or a specialized sentiment analysis model/API) to classify the sentiment of each effect as positive, negative, or neutral.
    *   Visually encode this sentiment information directly onto the prediction tree or mind map display. Common methods include color-coding nodes (e.g., green for positive, red for negative, grey/blue for neutral), using distinct icons, or displaying sentiment labels.
    *   This allows users to rapidly identify areas of concern (clusters of negative effects) or potential opportunities (clusters of positive effects), guiding their focus and further analysis.

## 9. Multi-Perspective Analysis
*   **Usefulness Rank:** 9
*   **Difficulty:** **[M]**
*   **Summary:** Allows users to define different "personas" or "stakeholders" (e.g., "CEO," "Customer," "Environmental Regulator," "Local Community"). The LLM can then be prompted to generate effects or summaries specifically considering the viewpoint, impact on, or reaction from these defined perspectives.
*   **Expanded Description:** Events and their consequences are rarely perceived or experienced uniformly by all affected parties. This feature would enable a more nuanced analysis by incorporating stakeholder perspectives:
    *   Users could define a set of relevant personas or stakeholder groups pertinent to their scenario (e.g., "Investors," "Employees," "Government Agencies," "General Public," "Competitors").
    *   When generating effects at any level, or when creating the overall summary, the user could select one or more of these defined personas.
    *   The prompts sent to the LLM would then be augmented to specifically ask for predictions considering the impact on, or the likely reaction from, these chosen perspectives. For example: "Generate 3 second-order effects of X *from the perspective of a small business owner*."
    *   This can reveal diverse impacts, potential conflicts of interest, or synergies between different stakeholder groups, leading to a richer and more comprehensive understanding of the scenario.

## 10. Influence Factor Identification
*   **Usefulness Rank:** 10
*   **Difficulty:** **[M]**
*   **Summary:** Prompts the LLM to identify and list key influencing factors, underlying assumptions, or critical prerequisites that would significantly alter a predicted effect or the likelihood of a particular branch of the prediction tree unfolding as projected.
*   **Expanded Description:** The validity and likelihood of predictions often hinge on various implicit assumptions and external conditions. This feature would enhance the analytical depth by prompting the LLM to explicitly identify these elements:
    *   **Key Assumptions:** What unstated beliefs or conditions underpin a specific prediction or branch?
    *   **Critical Dependencies/Prerequisites:** What external factors, resources, or prior events must be in place for this effect or pathway to occur?
    *   **Sensitivity Points/Levers:** What changes in conditions (e.g., economic, technological, political) would most significantly alter this outcome or its likelihood?
    *   The UI could display these identified factors alongside the relevant effects, in a dedicated analysis panel, or as annotations on the tree. This helps users understand the robustness and conditionality of the predictions, identify areas of high uncertainty, and pinpoint potential levers for intervention.

## 11. Customizable Prompts (Advanced Users)
*   **Usefulness Rank:** 11
*   **Difficulty:** **[M]**
*   **Summary:** For advanced users or researchers, provides an interface to view, edit, and customize the underlying prompts used by the system for generating first-order effects, higher-order effects, and summaries.
*   **Expanded Description:** To offer greater flexibility and control over the LLM's behavior, this feature would allow users with a deeper understanding of prompt engineering to modify the instructions given to the AI.
    *   An advanced settings area would display the default system prompts used for each stage of prediction (initial effects, recursive effects, summarization).
    *   Users could edit these prompts or create and save their own named prompt variations.
    *   The system would need to support template variables within these custom prompts (e.g., `{{context}}`, `{{num_effects}}`, `{{parent_effect_content}}`) to dynamically insert relevant information.
    *   This enables experimentation with different prompting strategies, tailoring the LLM's output for highly specific needs, or adapting to new LLM capabilities. It also requires clear warnings and potentially validation, as poorly constructed custom prompts could lead to errors or unexpected output formats that the application cannot parse.

## 12. "Counter-Argument" or "Alternative Outcome" Generation
*   **Usefulness Rank:** 12
*   **Difficulty:** **[M]**
*   **Summary:** For a given effect in the tree, allows the user to prompt the LLM to generate potential counter-arguments, reasons why that specific effect might *not* occur, or alternative, less obvious outcomes that could arise instead.
*   **Expanded Description:** To foster more critical thinking and help users avoid confirmation bias, this feature enables the exploration of dissenting or alternative viewpoints for any predicted effect.
    *   When a user selects an effect, they could trigger an option like "Challenge this effect" or "Explore alternatives."
    *   The LLM would then be prompted to:
        *   Generate reasons why the selected effect might not actually happen.
        *   Identify factors or conditions that could prevent its occurrence.
        *   Suggest alternative, perhaps less obvious or contrarian, outcomes that could result from the parent effect instead of the selected one.
    *   These counter-arguments or alternative outcomes could be displayed as annotations to the original effect, or even as new, alternative branches in the tree. This helps in understanding the full spectrum of possibilities and the conditions influencing different pathways.

## 13. Branch Comparison View
*   **Usefulness Rank:** 13
*   **Difficulty:** **[M]**
*   **Summary:** Allows users to select two or more different branches (originating from different root effects) of the prediction tree and view a side-by-side comparison of their respective downstream effects or an LLM-generated summary highlighting their key differences and divergences.
*   **Expanded Description:** When an initial scenario leads to multiple distinct first-order effects, each initiating its own cascade, users may want to directly compare these divergent future paths.
    *   The UI would enable the selection of two or more root effects or major branches within the prediction tree.
    *   A dedicated comparison view would then present these selected branches side-by-side. This could involve:
        *   Displaying their respective sub-trees up to a certain depth.
        *   Showing key metrics or aggregated data if features like likelihood or sentiment are implemented.
        *   Prompting the LLM to generate a comparative summary that explicitly highlights the key differences, commonalities, divergences in timelines, types of impact, or overall outlook between the selected branches.
    *   This aids in strategic decision-making by clarifying the distinct implications of different initial responses or developments.

## 14. "Focus Mode" for Branches/Effects
*   **Usefulness Rank:** 14
*   **Difficulty:** **[E]**
*   **Summary:** Allows users to select a specific effect (node) in the tree or mind map and temporarily hide or dim all other branches, enabling them to focus their attention solely on the downstream consequences and causal chain of that particular effect.
*   **Expanded Description:** As prediction trees grow in size and complexity, they can become visually overwhelming. Focus Mode aims to alleviate this by providing a way to "zoom in" on a specific area of interest.
    *   When a user selects any node in the tree or mind map and activates Focus Mode:
        *   The display would update to prominently feature the selected node and all its descendants (its sub-tree).
        *   All other parts of the tree (nodes not in the selected sub-tree) would be temporarily hidden, significantly dimmed, or collapsed.
    *   This is primarily a UI/UX enhancement that helps reduce visual clutter and allows users to concentrate on analyzing a particular line of reasoning or impact path without distraction from the rest of the tree. It would require good integration with the chosen tree/mind map visualization component to dynamically filter the display.

## 15. Scenario Templating
*   **Usefulness Rank:** 15
*   **Difficulty:** **[M]**
*   **Summary:** Allows users to create, save, and reuse scenario templates (e.g., "New Technology Impact Assessment," "Policy Change Analysis," "Competitor Move Response") with pre-defined structures, common configuration parameters, or boilerplate initial context prompts.
*   **Expanded Description:** For users or organizations that frequently analyze similar types of scenarios, templates can streamline the setup process, ensure consistency, and codify best practices.
    *   Users could define a template by specifying:
        *   A template name and description.
        *   Default configuration settings (e.g., prediction depth, number of effects per level, preferred LLM model).
        *   A boilerplate initial context prompt, potentially with placeholders for scenario-specific details (e.g., "Analyze the cascading effects of [New Technology Name] achieving [Key Milestone]...").
        *   Optionally, pre-defined stakeholder personas or analytical perspectives relevant to that type of scenario.
    *   When initiating a new futurecast, the user could choose from a list of saved templates, fill in any required placeholders, and begin the prediction process with many parameters already configured. This would be particularly useful in team settings or for standardized reporting.

## 16. Version History for FutureCasts
*   **Usefulness Rank:** 16
*   **Difficulty:** **[H]**
*   **Summary:** For saved futurecast scenarios, implements a version history system. Each time a significant change is made (e.g., editing context, re-generating a branch, changing core parameters), a new version of the futurecast is saved, allowing users to view, compare, or revert to previous states.
*   **Expanded Description:** Futurecasting is often an iterative process. As users explore a scenario, edit effects, re-run parts of the prediction, or adjust parameters, they might want to track these changes or go back to an earlier state of their analysis.
    *   This feature would automatically or manually (on user command) save a snapshot of the entire futurecast (initial context, full prediction tree, summary, and configuration settings) as a distinct version.
    *   The UI would provide a way to browse the version history for a given scenario, perhaps with timestamps and short descriptions of changes.
    *   Users could then view previous versions, compare two versions side-by-side (potentially highlighting differences in the tree structure or content), or restore a previous version as the current working version.
    *   This is a complex feature, especially if aiming for efficient storage (e.g., using diffs rather than full snapshots for each version) and robust comparison capabilities. It would ideally be built on top of a User Accounts & Cloud Storage system.

## 17. Alternative LLM Model Support
*   **Usefulness Rank:** 17
*   **Difficulty:** **[M-H]**
*   **Summary:** Allows users to select from a list of different Large Language Models (e.g., various Gemini versions, models from other providers like OpenAI or Anthropic, or potentially even open-source models if feasible) to perform the predictions.
*   **Expanded Description:** Different LLMs possess varying strengths, weaknesses, creative capabilities, analytical rigor, costs, and access methods. Providing users with a choice of models would enhance the application's flexibility and adaptability.
    *   The UI (likely in the configuration sidebar) would offer a dropdown menu to select from a list of supported LLM models.
    *   The backend would need to implement separate API client integrations for each supported model or provider. This includes handling different authentication mechanisms, API request/response formats, and potentially adapting prompt structures, as LLMs can be highly sensitive to the exact wording and formatting of prompts.
    *   Managing API keys for multiple providers securely would also be a key consideration. The difficulty ranges from medium (for integrating different models within the same family, e.g., various Gemini versions) to hard (for integrating models from entirely different providers or setting up inference for open-source models). Maintaining ongoing compatibility as models evolve would also be a challenge.

## 18. Confidence Level for Summary
*   **Usefulness Rank:** 18
*   **Difficulty:** **[E-M]**
*   **Summary:** When generating the overall summary of the futurecast, prompts the LLM to also provide a subjective confidence level (e.g., High, Medium, Low) in its own summary, based on the perceived coherence, plausibility, and completeness of the generated effects tree.
*   **Expanded Description:** Similar to assigning likelihood scores to individual effects, this feature would ask the LLM to perform a meta-assessment of the overall narrative summary it produces.
    *   The prompt used to generate the final summary could be augmented to include an instruction like: "After providing the summary, please also state your confidence level (High, Medium, or Low) that this summary accurately and comprehensively reflects the most likely unfolding of the scenario, given the predicted effects. Briefly explain the reason for your confidence level."
    *   This provides users with an additional, albeit subjective, data point from the LLM itself regarding the perceived internal consistency or speculative nature of the synthesized narrative. The main challenge is ensuring the LLM provides a meaningful and non-generic confidence assessment and explanation, rather than a boilerplate response.

## 19. Basic Collaboration Features (View/Comment)
*   **Usefulness Rank:** 19
*   **Difficulty:** **[H]**
*   **Summary:** If User Accounts and Cloud Storage are implemented, this feature would allow users to share a saved futurecast scenario with other registered users in a view-only or comment-only mode.
*   **Expanded Description:** Futurecasting and strategic foresight are often collaborative activities. This feature would introduce basic sharing and commenting capabilities:
    *   **Sharing Scenarios:** A user who owns a futurecast saved in the cloud system could share it with other specific registered users by entering their email or username.
    *   **Access Permissions:** The owner could set permissions for shared users, typically "View Only" (can see the context, tree, and summary but cannot make changes) or "Can Comment" (can view and add comments, perhaps attached to specific effects, branches, or the overall summary).
    *   **Commenting System:** A UI for adding, viewing, and replying to comments within the context of a shared futurecast.
    *   **Notifications (Optional):** Users might receive notifications when a scenario is shared with them or when new comments are added to a scenario they are part of.
    *   This feature heavily relies on the prior implementation of a robust User Accounts & Cloud Storage system. Real-time co-editing of the tree would be a significantly more complex undertaking and is not included in this "basic" feature.
